## GitOpsify Continuous Deployment

The training pipeline generates a new version of the model, whether it is triggered by a code change or a monitoring alert. As a next step, we need to make sure we deploy the new version automagically (yes, of course if only the new version performs better - hang in there) and we need to be able to provide traceability.
