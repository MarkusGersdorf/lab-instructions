## Training Pipeline

Pipelines help us to streamline the process of all the steps we do in the previous chapter (data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation), ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and efficient management of complex workflows.

Training pipelines are a foundational aspect of machine learning that enhance the workflow's efficiency, reliability, and scalability. They enable us to develop high-quality models quickly and effectively while ensuring that best practices are followed throughout the process. And especially when multiple steps and large datasets are involved,training pipelines reduce the potential for human error, save time, and enable data scientists to focus on model development rather than repetitive tasks.

We have two powerful tools to build pipelines; Elyra and Kubeflow Pipelines (KfP).

Elyra provides a user-friendly interface for building and managing pipelines directly within Jupyter notebooks, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation. On the other hand, Kubeflow Pipelines offers a robust framework for deploying and scaling machine learning workflows in production, leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration, resource management, and seamless integration with existing cloud environments. Together, they empower data scientists to efficiently transition from development to production, ensuring effective model management and deployment.
