## Data Science Project

1. Login to OpenShift AI. The link and the credentials will be provided by your instructor.

This project will be the place where we create our Jupyter Notebooke environment, train our model and deploy our model.

3. Let's create a notebook. Click `Create a Workbench`. OpenShift AI UI is pretty intiutive, isn't it? :)

   Select a name you want, could be something like `hitmusic-wb` ðŸŽº

    For Notebook Image: 

    - Image selection: `Standard Data Science`

    - Version selection: `2024.1`

    - Deployment size: `Small`
    - Cluster storage: `20 GB`. 
    
    Let's keep the `Data connections` part empty for now. We'll get back to this later.

    And finally, hit `Create`.

4. When it is in the running stage, just click `Open`.

   It will redirect you to the Jupyter Notebook UI. You need to use your credentials again to log in. If you see the below screen, click `Allow selected permissions`. That will redirect you to your Jupyter Notebook.

5. Clone the Git repository that has model source code. Click the Git icon from the left menu, then select `Clone a Repository`. Copy the    GitHub link and clone the repository.

    ```bash
    https://github.com/rhoai-mlops/jukebox.git
    ```

    And now, your working environment is ready to get your hands dirty with some data!ðŸ’¥ðŸ’ª

    But before, there are two things we need to get done; setup our own Git repository and some S3 storage for experimentation ðŸ«¡
