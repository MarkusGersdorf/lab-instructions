## User Workload Monitoring

> OpenShiftâ€™s has monitoring capabilities built in. It deploys the Prometheus stack and integrates into the OpenShift UI for consuming cluster metrics. 

1. Let's view some out of the box dashboards. Go to OpenShift AI UI > `<USER_NAME>-test` > Model Serving view and click on `jukebox` model.

    You can see the graphs about incoming requests, CPU and memory consumption to give you an idea about the model utilization.

2. There are other metrics that the runtime exposes and OpenShift collects out of the box. You can run queries for the existing metrics easily with `promql`, a query language for Prometheus, and then decide if there are more metrics you would like to visualize. On the OpenShift UI, go to Observe, it should show basic health indicators just like OpenShift AI UI.

    There are multiple dashboards already ready for you to observe your deployed model `jukebox`. Generate some traffic by using the Jukebox UI and check here!


3. You can also query Prometheus by using promql query language to get some info about successfull requests to `jukebox` in your test environment. 

    Go to  `Metrics` tab and paste the below query and hit `Enter`.

    ```bash
    ovms_requests_success{namespace="<USER_NAME>-test", interface="REST"}
    ```

### Deploy Grafana

> Let's create some more dashboards with specific information about our model!

1. We can deploy a Grafana instance in our `mlops` environment. Yet another tooling to support the end to end journey of Jukebox Therefore we need to install it through `mlops-gitops/toolings/`

    Create `grafana` folder under `toolings`. And then create a file called `config.yaml` under `grafana` folder. Or simply run the below commands:

    ```bash
    mkdir /opt/app-root/src/mlops-gitops/toolings/grafana
    touch /opt/app-root/src/mlops-gitops/toolings/grafana/config.yaml
    ```

2. Open up the `grafana/config.yaml` file and paste the below line to let Argo CD know which chart we want to deploy.

    ```yaml
    chart_path: charts/grafana
    ```

3. Commit the changes to the repo as youâ€™ve done before.

    ```bash
    cd /opt/app-root/src/mlops-gitops
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=172800'
    git pull
    git add .
    git commit -m "ðŸ“ˆ Grafana added ðŸ“ˆ"
    git push
    ```

3. Once this change has been syncâ€™d (you can check this in Argo CD), letâ€™s login to Grafana and view the predefined dashboards for Jukebox;

    ```bash
    # get the route and open it in your browser
    echo https://$(oc get route jukebox-grafana-route --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n <USER_NAME>-mlops)

    ```

Use `Log in with OpenShift` to login and display the dashboards. As we define the dashboards as code, all the changes you make here will be temporary, they won't persist. True GitOps ðŸ‘»


4. In order to view the dashboards, go to `Dashboards` > `grafana <USER_NAME>-mlops Dashboards` > `OpenVINO Model Server - Model Metrics`

5. There are some dashboards that are not being populated yet and it is because we haven't enabled yet another exciting tool; TrustyAI.
