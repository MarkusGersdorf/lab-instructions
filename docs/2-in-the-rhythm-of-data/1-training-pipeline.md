## Training Pipeline

Pipelines help us to streamline the process of all the steps we did in the previous chapter (data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation), ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and efficient management of complex workflows.

Training pipelines are a foundational aspect of machine learning that enhance the workflow's efficiency, reliability, and scalability. They enable us to develop high-quality models quickly and effectively while ensuring that good practices are followed throughout the process. And especially when multiple steps and large datasets are involved, training pipelines reduce the potential for human error, saves time, and enables data scientists to focus on model development rather than repetitive tasks.

We have two powerful tools to build pipelines; Elyra and Kubeflow Pipelines (KfP). Let's get familiar with both!
