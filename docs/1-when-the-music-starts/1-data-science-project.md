## Data Science Project

1. Login to [OpenShift AI](https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>). The link and the credentials will be provided by your instructor. You'll see there are already two `Data Science Projects` created for you.

2. Click on the <USER_NAME> project. This project will be the place where we create our Jupyter Notebook environment, train our model and deploy our model.

3. Let's create a notebook. Click `Create a Workbench`. OpenShift AI UI is pretty intiutive, isn't it? :)

   Select a name you want, could be something like `hitmusic-wb` ðŸŽº

    For Notebook Image: 

    - Image selection: `Standard Data Science`

    - Version selection: `2024.2`

    - Container size: `Small`
    - Cluster storage: `Create new persistent storage` with size `20 GB`. 
    
    - Check `Use a data connection` and choose the second option `Use existing data connection`
    
      From the dropdown menu, select `models`
       

    And finally, hit `Create workbench`.

4. When the status of the new workbench indicates 'Running', click `Open`.

   It will redirect you to the Jupyter Notebook UI. You need to use your credentials again to log in. If you see the below screen, click `Allow selected permissions`. That will redirect you to your Jupyter Notebook.

5. There are a couple of Git repositories already set up under your username in Gitea server. You can verify them by logging in Gitea [here](https://<GIT_SERVER>):

    ```bash
    https://<GIT_SERVER>
    ```
6. Use the same credentials to login and verify that you have 3 repositories waiting to be user for the upcoming exercises. Spoiler alert: be on the watch out for GitOps ðŸ¦„ðŸ”¥

7. Now, we'll start with `Jukebox` repository, the one that has model source code. Go back to your Jupyter Notebook, click the Git icon from the top of the left menu and, copy the GitHub link to clone the repository.

    ```bash
    https://<GIT_SERVER>/<USER_NAME>/jukebox.git
    ```

    And now, your working environment is ready to get your hands dirty with some data!ðŸ’¥ðŸ’ª
